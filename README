Welcome to Lumen!

Lumen is (or will be someday) a GUI toolkit for Ada.

It is written entirely in Ada (with a few insignificant exceptions, like in
the Linux joystick code, no direct calling of ioctl from Ada yet), based on
OpenGL and thus expected to be portable across OS's (currently runs on X11
sytems like Linux and the *BSD's).
Once somebody steps up and writes the low-level portions for Windows, it
will run there too.

The root of the documentation source is "doc/index.markdown".

Enjoy, and visit the public git repository at either of these two places:

   https://github.com/darkestkhan/lumen2

There are a number of simple demo applications that show off various aspects
of Lumen; they are available here:

   https://github.com/darkestkhan/lumen2-demos

To build with different than default CPU switches add "-XCPU=switches" to
gprbuild command. Defualt CPU switches are: "-march=native -fPIC"

To build lumen2 on Debian-like systems you will need to install these packages:
libx11-dev
libglu1-mesa-dev
libgl1-mesa-dev
libdlrestrictions-dev

To build projects depending on lumen you will need to add following linker
switches:
-lX11 -GL -lGLU -ldl
