Welcome to Lumen!

Lumen is (or will be someday) a GUI toolkit for Ada.

It is written entirely in Ada (with a few insignificant exceptions,
like in the Linux joystick code, no direct calling of ioctl from Ada
yet), based on OpenGL and thus expected to be portable across OS's
once somebody steps up and writes the low-level portions for
MS-Windows and OS-X.

The root of the documentation source is "doc/index.markdown".  The
formatted docs should be available here:

Enjoy, and visit the public git repository at either of these two places:

   git://ftp.niestu.com/lumen
