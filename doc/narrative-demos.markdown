Title: Index to Narrative Descriptions of the Lumen Demo Applications

These are the narratives discussing the various demonstration applications
that are provided with the Lumen library.  Most of the demos are probably
slanted toward the X window system; MS-Windows and Mac users of Lumen, if
there ever are any, may not be familiar with some of the terms.

* **[`colors`][colors]**: An adaptation of the "glXIntro" demo app, showing
  the simplest and most basic way to create a window, draw something in it,
  and handle some limited input events.

* **[`sgi_simple`][sgi_simple]**: A port of the old SGI demo app "simple",
  again very basic, showing a different way to handle input events.

* **[`spinner`][spinner]**: Showing use of the animation package, and a third
  way to do event handlers.

* **[`texture`][texture]**: A variant of `spinner` showing use of the image
    loading package.
