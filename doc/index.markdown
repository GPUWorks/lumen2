Title: The Lumen User Interface Library

<h1 class="centered">The Lumen User Interface Library</h1>

Lumen is a user interface library for Ada designed to support visually oriented
applications such as games, simulations, and visualization.

As of the spring of 2010, development on Lumen has started to accelerate.
Here are the current documents available:

* How to [get and install][install] the current Lumen code.
    
Some informal documents related to the current code:

* An informal narrative description of [the Lumen library][nlumen].

* An informal narrative description of [the demo applications][ndemos].

And some older documents which still have some interesting information in them:

* The [original introduction page][intro].  Somewhat outdated, but still useful.

* The [original rationale][rat], also somewhat outdated, but still very much
  relevant.

Look for more to be added to this page in the days and weeks ahead!

<h2 class="centered">Bug Reports</h2>

You may report bugs in Lumen, or ask about difficulties in using it, on the
\#Ada IRC channel on [the Freenode IRC network][freenode].  There's also a
[web-based bug tracker][jira] for Lumen on the AuroraUX site, thanks to those
fine folks, especially Jerrid Kimball.  Be sure to select "Lumen" under
"Projects" if you use that page.
