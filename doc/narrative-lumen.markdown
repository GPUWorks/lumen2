Title: Narrative Descriptions of the Lumen Library

These are links to some simple narrative descriptions of the Lumen library.
They are not intended to be formal documents, so no heckling.  The documents,
and the library as it's coded now, are probably slanted toward the X window
system; MS-Windows and Mac users of Lumen, if there ever are any, may not be
familiar with some of the terms.
